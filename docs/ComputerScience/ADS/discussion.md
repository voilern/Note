### Week 2

**2-1** When it would be optimal to prefer Red-black trees over AVL trees?

**2-2** Please design an algorithm to adjust the structure of a red-black tree from top-down during an insertion.  That is, after inserting the node, we should no longer have to make any rotation.

**2-3** When to prefer B+ trees over B-trees?
